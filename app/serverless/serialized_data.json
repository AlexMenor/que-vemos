That successor could be fiery Vincent (Andy Garcia) but he may also be the spark that turns Michael's hope of business legitimacy into an inferno of mob violence. The film\u2019s meticulously restored picture and sound, under the supervision of American Zoetrope and Paramount Pictures, includes a new beginning and ending, as well as changes to scenes, shots, and music cues. The resulting project reflects author Mario Puzo and Coppola\u2019s original intentions of The Godfather: Part III, and delivers, in the words of Coppola, \u201ca more appropriate conclusion to The Godfather and The Godfather: Part II.\u201d",
